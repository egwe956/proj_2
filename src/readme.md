General Assembly Project 2 - done by Evans Wu

What led me to the creation of this project:

I decided to build this app as I recalled an experience that I had when I was growing up.

There was this visually impaired guitarist who used to busk outside Centrepoint between the years of 2004-2006.

He was a very proficient and musical despite the fact that he could not see well. However, he was more well known in music circles because of his mismatched guitar.

You see, as he was visually impaired, it led to him being scammed. This is how a guitar typically looks like.

His guitar had a mix of neon green, and neon pink pickups because he could not verify whether it was the colour he wanted.

This led me to think about developing an app for visually impaired people. What if there was an app that could tell you the properties of an item and verbally read it out?

How to use:

You can either submit a local file via your local computer, or you can submit a URL of a picture.

Remember to turn up your computer volume as the properties of the photo will be read out to you.
